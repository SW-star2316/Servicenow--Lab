# Description 
In this project, I used a developer version of ServiceNow to get familiar with how it works. I practiced creating and managing support tickets to better understand the platform. The main goal was to get comfortable using ServiceNow and learn how to navigate its interface.
# Developer Instance 
The lab started by setting up a free developer account for ServiceNow. To do this, I used Google to search for a way to access a ServiceNow developer environment. I searched for “ServiceNow developer instance free,” which led me to the official site where I could sign up. After creating my account, I was able to access a personal developer instance and begin exploring what it’s like to work with the ServiceNow platform.
